# Star Wars Wiki

Welcome to the Star Wars Wiki project! This website offers users an engaging platform to explore the vast Star Wars universe. Featuring an intuitive interface, it allows for easy discovery of details about planets, characters, films, and starships.

## Features

- **Explore Planets:** Detailed information about various planets in the Star Wars universe.
- **Character Profiles:** In-depth profiles of characters, including their backgrounds and home planets.
- **Film Information:** Comprehensive data on all Star Wars films.
- **Starship Details:** Specifications and histories of starships from the series.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dibsnvas/Star-Wars-Wikipedia.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Star-Wars-Wikipedia
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed! See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can use the interface to:

- **Browse Planets:** Navigate to the planets section to see a list of planets and click on any planet to get detailed information.
- **View Characters:** Explore the characters section to view profiles and learn more about their backgrounds and home planets.
- **Check Films:** Access the films section to get information about all Star Wars movies.
- **Discover Starships:** Go to the starships section to see detailed specifications and histories of various starships.

## API Integration

The website is connected to the StarWarsAPI, a popular source of data for Star Wars information. This integration allows the website to provide real-time data updates, enhancing the user experience.

### How to Use the API

The application makes use of the StarWarsAPI to fetch data. You can explore the API documentation and endpoints here:
